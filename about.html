            <p>James Mitchell was born on a small, remote, Pacific Island named Yap. At the time of his birth, Yap was under the Trust Territory of the Pacific. A regional trust set up 
                after World War 2 intended to stabilize the region as much of it had recently been freed from Japanese colonialism. James' family was heavily invested in the founding of
                the Federated States of Micronesia. His Father, Theodore Mitchell, was sent by the United States of America to set up legal systems in this new country. His Grandfather,
                Joachim Falmog, was a member of a group known as "Faak e Puul" or "Children of the Moon". This group assisted US Troops with the initial takeover of the island, then served
                as local counsel to US Representatives when standing up the new country. This partnership created a tradition where Yapese youths will join the US Military.
            </p>
            <p>Following this tradition, a young James Mitchell would enlist in the Military during the early years of Operation Iraqi Freedom. James' choice to serve
                was not out of a sense of Patriotism, but it was driven by a deep desire to repay the kindness that his people received and the desire to help the US bring freedom to people who
                yearn for it. During his time uniform, James Mitchell served as a mechanic, a military advisor to the Iraqi Army, a petroleum supply specialist, and on many missions vital to the support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
                A life of military service was not in the cards. After completing the Active Duty portion of his contract James joins the Army Reserves and searches for "what comes next".
            </p>
            <p>After leaving, James gets his start in the IT Industry by studying Computer Networking Technologies at St Clair College in Windsor Ontario. James would spend most of his days in Ontario, 
                driving down to Ohio once a month to meet his Army Reserve Obligations. Juggling college courses and Military service was not an easy task, and upon graduating with a 3.4GPA, James set out to find work in his new industry.
                <p>Sutherland Global Services:<br/>
                    James' first job out of the military was at Sutherland Global's call center in Windsor Ontario. This was not the job James wanted, but James was not known for wasting an opportunity.
                    James would use the work ethic he developed in the US Army to quickly climb the organizational ranks. Making it to a Back Office Team before his initial 90 day probationary period was over. Then
                    quickly being transitioned to a newly created "Team Lead Quarterback" role. While in this role, James was able to provide ISP Support to the 2016 Oscars. Sutherland Global would later be sent an honorary oscar for "Best Technical Support".                    
                </p>
                <p>Windsor Mold: <br/>
                    James left Sutherland Global after landing a new job in Windsor Mold Inc's service desk as a Service Desk Technician. Once again, the work ethic James developed in the military would 
                    separate him from the pack. After completing his 90 probationary period, Windsor Mold would ask him to take on a newly created "Senior Service Desk Technician" role. After a year,
                    James would be promoted to Service Desk Supervisor. Less than a year after that, James absorbs the entire OPs side of the IT department and taking the Infrastructure support, and Applications Support,
                    under his purview. It was here, that James realized that leading in the civilian world, is very different than leading in the military world. James also learned that he didn't like leading anymore, juggling ego was not something he was interested in.
                    James would then set off, once again, in search of a new role. For the first time ever, James would quit a job without having another one lined up. Normally, he wouldn't have taken this risk. However, circumstances at his previous position had become so dysfunctional that James had to choose between money, or his mental health. James knew that ultimately his children would prefer a caring father over a rich one, but he also knew, that a roof over their heads
                    and food in their belly was more important than anything. So, he licks his wounds and starts searching, once again, for what is next.

                <p>The Family of Companies:<br/>
                    Enter Don Wright, and the Family of Companies. James' reaches out to an acquaintance of his, Don Wright, who works for a company known at the time as Quicken Loans. James and Don had met a few years earlier. James
                    had heard of Quicken Loans but didn't know anything about it other than they owned a basketball team in Cleveland and they did something with loans. Don advised James to visit Quicken's hiring site and give it a try.
                    James would later find out, that Don is on the Veteran Hiring Team and had picked up his resume. Don explains the process to James, but lets James know, that he's on his own during the interview, and that there would be a "technical" interview, but he didn't know what was on it.
                    Thankfully, James knows that if he can get the interview, he will likely land the job. James was never good at marketing himself on paper, but he knew that his work ethic, and ability to adapt, would speak for themselves. Surely enough,
                    James landed a job with Rock Central as a Desktop Support Technician. James would go on to be a strong member of the Desktop team and would frequently be requested by name by Team Member's he has supported. Eager to try something new,
                    James applies for the DevBuild Program and is accepted.
