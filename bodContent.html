        <p><h3>Bamboo Rafts to Save the Planet</h3>
            In my youth, I attempted to create a sustainable method of sea transport using bamboo as the primary building material for a boat.
            The seacraft would be propelled forward using an elongated rod that would create tension and friction on the ocean floor. This project
            was never picked up by major investors. Instead me and my brothers used it as a normal bamboo raft for swimming and fishing purposes.

            <h3>Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock</h3>
            This is an upgrade to traditional rock paper scissors. The much anticipated expansion to the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors is finally here.
            Completely ripped off from TV's <span id="bbt">The Big Bang Theory</span>, players have an additional 2 options when it comes time to "throw"
            <ol id="rpslsrules">
                <li>Scissors cut Paper</li>
                <li>Paper covers Rock</li>
                <li>Rock crushes Lizard</li>
                <li>Lizard poisons Spock</li>
                <li>Paper disproves Spock</li>
                <li>Spock vaporizes Rock</li>
                <li>and as it always has, Rock crushes Scissors</li>
            </ol>
